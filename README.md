## Introduction
AV-HuBERT is a self-supervised representation learning framework for audio-visual speech. It achieves state-of-the-art results in lip reading, ASR and audio-visual speech recognition on the LRS3 audio-visual speech benchmark.

## Demo
Run our lip-reading demo using Colab: [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bNXkfpHiVHzXQH8WjGhzQ-fsDxolpUjD)

## Installation
First, create a conda virtual environment and activate it:
```
conda create -n avhubert python=3.8 -y
conda activate avhubert
```
Then, clone this directory:
```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/av_hubert.git
cd av_hubert
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Lastly, install Fairseq and the other packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd fairseq
pip install --editable ./
```

## Load a pretrained model
```sh
$ cd avhubert
$ python
>>> import fairseq
>>> import hubert_pretraining, hubert
>>> ckpt_path = "/path/to/the/checkpoint.pt"
>>> models, cfg, task = fairseq.checkpoint_utils.load_model_ensemble_and_task([ckpt_path])
>>> model = models[0]
```

## Train a new model

### Data preparation

Follow the steps in [`preparation`](avhubert/preparation/) to pre-process:
- LRS3 and VoxCeleb2 datasets

Follow the steps in [`clustering`](avhubert/clustering/) (pre-train only) to create:
- `{train,valid}.km` frame-aligned pseudo label files.
The `label_rate` is the same as the feature frame rate used for clustering,
which is 100Hz for MFCC features and 25Hz for AV-HuBERT features by default.

### Pre-train an AV-HuBERT model

Suppose `{train,valid}.tsv` are saved at `/path/to/data`, `{train,valid}.km`
are saved at `/path/to/labels`, the configuration file is saved at `/path/to/conf/conf-name`, and the label rate is 100Hz.

To train a model, run:
```sh
$ cd avhubert
$ fairseq-hydra-train --config-dir /path/to/conf/ --config-name conf-name \
  task.data=/path/to/data task.label_dir=/path/to/label \
  model.label_rate=100 hydra.run.dir=/path/to/experiment/pretrain/ \
  common.user_dir=`pwd`
```

### Finetune an AV-HuBERT model with Seq2Seq
Suppose `{train,valid}.tsv` are saved at `/path/to/data`, `{train,valid}.wrd`
are saved at `/path/to/labels`, the configuration file is saved at `/path/to/conf/conf-name`.

To fine-tune a pre-trained HuBERT model at `/path/to/checkpoint`, run:
```sh
$ cd avhubert
$ fairseq-hydra-train --config-dir /path/to/conf/ --config-name conf-name \
  task.data=/path/to/data task.label_dir=/path/to/label \
  task.tokenizer_bpe_model=/path/to/tokenizer model.w2v_path=/path/to/checkpoint \
  hydra.run.dir=/path/to/experiment/finetune/ common.user_dir=`pwd`
```

### Decode an AV-HuBERT model
Suppose the `test.tsv` and `test.wrd` are the video list and transcripts of
the split to be decoded, saved at `/path/to/data`, and the fine-tuned model is
saved at `/path/to/checkpoint`.

#### Seq2Seq decoding

`task.normalize` needs to be consistent with the value used during fine-tuning.
Decoding results will be saved at
`/path/to/experiment/decode/s2s/test`.

```sh
$ cd avhubert
$ python -B infer_s2s.py --config-dir ./conf/ --config-name conf-name \
  dataset.gen_subset=test common_eval.path=/path/to/checkpoint \
  common_eval.results_path=/path/to/experiment/decode/s2s/test \
  override.modalities=['video'] common.user_dir=`pwd`
```

The command above uses the default decoding hyperparameter, which can be found
in `conf/s2s_decode.yaml`. `override.modalities` can be set to `['video']` (for lip reading),
or `['audio']` (for ASR) or `['audio','video']` (for audio-visual speech recognition).These parameters can be
configured from the command line. For example, to search with a beam size of
20, we can append the command above with `generation.beam=20`.
Important parameters include:
- generation.beam
- generation.lenpen

#### Different test set
If your test data are stored in a different directory with the training data, append the following to the above command.

`+override.data=/path/to/test +override.label_dir=/path/to/test`

, where `/path/to/test` contains `test.{tsv,wrd}`. This is useful when you want to test with the fine-tuned checkpoints we provide.

#### Test under noisy environment
If you want to test your model under noisy environment, append the following to the above command.

`+override.noise_wav=/path/to/noise override.noise_prob=1 override.noise_snr={snr}` 

 `{snr}` is the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and `/path/to/noise` is a folder containing noise manifest files (`/path/to/noise/{valid,test}.tsv`). See [`preparation`](avhubert/preparation/) for setting up this folder.
